						<h4>Cruel Summer</h4>
							<p>
								"Cruel Summer" is a song by the American
								singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and Jack 
								Antonoff produced the song, and they wrote 
								it with St. Vincent. "Cruel Summer" is a 
								synth-pop, industrial pop, and electropop 
								song composed of synths, wobbling beats, 
								and vocoder-manipulated vocals. The lyrics 
								are about an intense romance during a painful 
								summer.

							<h5>Lyrics</h5>
							<p>
								"Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
								You know that I caught it
								Bad, bad boy
								Shiny toy with a price
								You know that I bought it
								Killing me slow, out the window
								I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
								Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
								What doesn't kill me makes me want you more."

						<h4>I Forgot That You Existed</h4>
							<p>
								"I Forgot That You Existed is a symbolic 
								song that closes Taylor Swift's reputation 
								era and opens the Lover era. The song describes 
								her indifference over a past grudge, metaphorically 
								closing that chapter on her past and writing a new 
								storybook that stretches into the future."
							</p>
							<h5>Release</h5>
							<p>August 23, 2019</p>
							<h5>Lyrics</h5>
							<p>
								"How many days did I spent thinking
								'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
								Lived in the shade you were throwing
								'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
								And I couldn't get away from you
								In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
								Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
								Free rent, living in my mind
								But then something happened one magical night
								I forgot that you existed."

							<p>
								"Karma" is a song by the American 
								singer-songwriter Taylor Swift from 
								her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022). 
								Swift wrote and produced the song with 
								Jack Antonoff, Sounwave, and Keanu Beats, 
								while Jahaan Sweet co-produced it. Republic

							<h5>Release</h5>
							<p>August 23, 2019</p>
							<h5>Lyrics</h5>
							<p>
								"You're talking shit for the hell of it
								Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
								You're terrified to look down
								'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
								Of everyone you burned just to get there
								It's coming back around
								And I keep my side of the street clean
								You wouldn't know what I mean
								'Cause karma is my boyfriend
								Karma is a god
								Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
								Karma's a relaxing thought
								Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
								Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
								Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
								Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
								Me and karma vibe like that."
